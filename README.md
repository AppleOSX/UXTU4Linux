Adjust power management settings for AMD Ryzen APUs, Universal x86 Tuning Utility for Linux
## Just an idea, we still do not have any plans for this repo at the moment, this tool will support Ubuntu/Debian-based distros first
### ETA: After 14/6/2024
# Merged to [UXTU4Unix](https://github.com/AppleOSX/UXTU4Unix) after ver 0.2.8
