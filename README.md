# UXTU4Linux
Adjust power management settings for AMD Ryzen APUs, Universal x86 Tuning Utility for Linux
## Just an idea, we still do not have any plans for this repo at the moment, this tool will support Ubuntu/Debian-based distros first
### ETA: After 14/6/2024
# Merged to [UXTU4Unix](https://github.com/AppleOSX/UXTU4Unix) after ver 0.2.8

> [!CAUTION]
> - We **think** the members and owners of ChefKiss Inc shouldn't use this tool. Why? Because Visual **will** say `Do not use this tool because it will break our NootedRed/AMDPlatformPlugin power management, etc...`. So, is that true? We still don't know because I've been banned from both Telegram and GitHub by ChefKiss (Visual)
